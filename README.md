# JavaFX Interactive Games Collection

A collection of three interactive JavaFX applications demonstrating GUI programming skills, event handling, and game logic implementation.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Mouse Drawing Canvas (`mouseDragging`)
**Interactive drawing application with real-time mouse tracking**
- **Features:** Mouse click/drag/move detection, dynamic visual feedback, canvas clearing
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Event handling, graphics rendering, real-time user interaction
- **UI:** Single canvas with color-coded responses (red=click, blue=drag, green=move)

### 2. Math Challenge Game (`calcolateGame`) 
**Educational puzzle game for arithmetic practice**
- **Features:** 5x5 grid of numbered buttons, addition equation solving, score tracking
- **Game Logic:** Players select 3 numbers where first + second = third
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Dynamic UI generation, game state management, validation logic
- **UI:** Grid layout with buttons, progress tracking, alert dialogs

### 3. Rectangle Selection Game (`squareClicks`)
**Precision-based clicking game with visual feedback**
- **Features:** Random rectangle generation, smallest-rectangle identification, dual-canvas transfer
- **Game Logic:** Players must click the smallest rectangle to transfer it between canvases
- **Skills Demonstrated:** 2D graphics, collision detection, data structure management
- **UI:** Two-canvas layout with automatic rectangle positioning

## Technical Highlights
- **Framework:** JavaFX with FXML UI design
- **Architecture:** MVC pattern with separate controller classes
- **Programming Concepts:** Event handling, collections, random generation, graphics contexts
- **User Experience:** Intuitive interfaces with immediate visual feedback
